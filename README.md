# Mini Project: Applying Business Intelligence Tools on VG Sales Data

## 📌 Introduction
Business Intelligence (BI) tools transform raw data into actionable insights through dashboards and reports.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Power BI** and **Tableau** on VG Sales Data to analyze trends, create interactive dashboards, and compare the strengths of both tools.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
- Traditional analysis methods are static and time-consuming.  
- Large and diverse datasets are hard to manage effectively.  
- Lack of real-time insights delays decision-making.  

BI tools like Power BI and Tableau overcome these challenges by offering interactive and scalable solutions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate how Power BI and Tableau can simplify data analysis.  
- Compare the features and strengths of both tools.  
- Showcase dashboards that support decision-making.  

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Datasets Used**: Sales, Employee Performance, Financial Data, Customer Feedback.  
- **Steps**: Data Integration → Data Cleaning → Dashboard Creation → Insights Sharing.  
- **Tools & Techniques**: Calculated fields, forecasting, slicers, filters, drill-downs.  

## 📊 Results
### 🔹 Power BI
